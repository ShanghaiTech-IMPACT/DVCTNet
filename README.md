This repository contains the code and dataset for our paper "Adapting Foundation Model for Dental Caries Detection with Dual-View Co-Training" in MICCAI 2025.

## Updates
- [09/2025] Source code released!
- [06/2025] Our paper is accepted by MICCAI 2025!

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.1+
- CUDA runtime 11.8 (recommended)
- mmdet 3.3.0
- mmcv 2.1.0
   
Run the following command to install the required packages with conda:

```
git clone https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.git
conda create -f environment.yml
```

Install all the required packages by pip(unrecommended):
```
git clone https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have any questions about the installation process, please refer to the [mmdetection documentation](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.0/get_started.html).

## Training and Testing
Before training and testing, the environment variables PYTHONPATH should be appended:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./mmdet_custom
```
To train the model, run the following command:

```
python tools/train.py \
    configs/models/dvctnet_dinov2_base_fpn_50_epoch.py
```
or you can use the shell script `train.sh` in scripts folder to train the model.
```
bash scripts/train.sh
```

To test the model, run the following command:

```
python tools/test.py \
    configs/models/dvctnet_dinov2_base_fpn_50_epoch.py \
    <checkpoint_path> \
```

To learn more about the configuration files and training and testing process, please refer to the [mmdetection documentation](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.0/).
